# Let Me Out - A Psychological Horror UX Experience

"Let Me Out" is an experimental interactive experience that explores the dark side of user experience design through psychological horror elements. This project simulates a reality-bending journey that progressively intensifies, manipulating users through deceptive interfaces and psychological tactics.

## Concept

This experiment creates an immersive horror experience through interface design alone. It explores two distinct paths:

1. **Classic Mode** - A linear narrative that guides users through a sequence of increasingly disturbing interface manipulations.
2. **Infinite UX Spiral** - An endless psychological trap that evolves based on user behavior, creating a personalized nightmare experience.

## Key Components

### Core Experience Elements

- **MirrorError** - The convergence point where both user paths face broken versions of themselves
- **ShadowCompetitor** - Fake multiplayer element showing others outperforming the user
- **EvolvingNarrator** - AI assistant that evolves through four distinct psychological phases
- **ImpossibleMoralChoice** - Ethical dilemmas with no positive outcomes
- **TruthReveal** - The final confrontation with meta-reality

### Psychological Horror Techniques

This project implements various dark patterns and psychological manipulation techniques:

1. **False Choices** - Decisions that appear meaningful but lead to the same negative outcomes
2. **Social Comparison** - Creating feelings of inadequacy through fake competitor profiles
3. **Existential Dread** - Questioning the user's purpose and reality
4. **Gaslighting** - Contradictory system messages that make users question their memory
5. **Reality Distortion** - Visual glitches and reality-breaking effects

## Dark UX Patterns

The spiral presents various manipulative interface patterns:

- **Breeding Modals** - Every closed modal spawns two more
- **Option Crumble** - UI elements that fade away as the user hesitates
- **Ghost Cursor Duel** - A fake cursor that competes with and outperforms the user
- **Identity Mirror Loop** - Distorts user inputs and gaslights correction attempts
- **Looping Undo Ghost** - Changes unrelated UI elements when the user tries to undo

## Technical Implementation

Built with React, TypeScript, and Framer Motion for fluid animations. The application tracks various psychological metrics:

- **Frustration Score** - Measures user's growing annoyance
- **Chaos Level** - Tracks the system's perceived instability
- **Suspicion Level** - Measures user's growing distrust of the system

## Ethical Consideration

This project serves as an educational tool to identify and understand dark UX patterns. By experiencing these manipulative techniques firsthand, users become more aware of similar tactics used in commercial applications.

**IMPORTANT**: This is an experimental project meant to explore psychological horror through interface design. The psychological effects can be intense, and the experience is intended for educational and artistic purposes only.

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
5. Descend into madness

## Disclaimer

This project intentionally creates an uncomfortable experience to highlight manipulative design practices. The interfaces are designed to confuse, frustrate, and unsettle users as an artistic and educational exploration of dark patterns in UX design.

Enter at your own risk. There may be no way out.
