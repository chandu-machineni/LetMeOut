# Let Me Out - An Evil UX Experiment

A game-like experience that demonstrates dark patterns and manipulative UI/UX techniques in web design - as satire and educational commentary.

## Overview

"Let Me Out" is an interactive demonstration of manipulative UI/UX techniques. It guides users through a series of increasingly frustrating interfaces that mirror real-world dark patterns, while gradually introducing chaotic elements that make the experience progressively more hostile.

The project serves as a:
- ðŸŽ® **Playable UX Nightmare**: Progressive game-like experience with chaotic elements
- ðŸŽ­ **Dark Pattern Showcase**: Educational demonstration of manipulative UI designs
- ðŸªž **Design Commentary**: Satirical take on the worst UX practices

## Evil Features

- **Progressive Chaos System**: Interaction increases chaos level (1-5), making UI increasingly hostile
- **Suspicion Tracking**: User hesitation and exploration is monitored and changes the experience
- **Identity Corruption**: User data gets progressively glitched/corrupted throughout the flow
- **Narrator AI**: Evil narrator that taunts users based on their behavior patterns
- **Visual Glitching**: Interface elements that move, dodge, animate and disrupt with increasing intensity
- **Dynamic Layering**: Z-indexed overlay system for proper stacking of interactive elements

## The Journey

### Stage 1: Welcome & Name Scrambler
- Collects user name then corrupts it for all future display
- Introduction to the narrator with ASCII villain face
- Animated placeholder text, visual corruption feedback

### Stage 2: Theme Customization
- Beautiful theme cards that are completely deceptive
- No matter what's selected, a contradictory theme is applied
- Narrator roasts the user for their choice

### Stage 3: Checkbox Hell
- Terms & Conditions with impossible-to-click checkboxes
- Elements that move away from mouse cursor
- Hidden text revealed by unusual interaction patterns

### Stage 4: Identity Verification
- Form fields that swap/change values
- Auto-correcting inputs that change user entries
- "Update" button showing wrong entered data

### Stage 5: Soul Acquisition
- Replaces original pricing screen with soul-selling metaphor
- Sliders that decrease autonomously
- "Submit DNA" button with fake processing

### Stage 6: Fake Progress
- Loading bar that fails at 99%
- Complex terminal-like fake processing animations
- Narrator builds anticipation then crushes it

### Stage 7: False Victory
- Completion screen that glitches apart
- Corrupted user profile display
- Transition to next stage with distortion effects

### Stage 8: UX Museum
- Educational tour of common dark patterns
- Philosophical asides about UX ethics
- Sets up final loop or secret room discovery

### Hidden: Truth Room
- Secret accessible via Konami code or typing "I surrender"
- Developer commentary on dark patterns
- Real user experience principles highlighted

## Persistent Elements

- **Cookie Consent Banner**: Never fully dismissable, rotates text
- **Cursor Distractor**: Elements that follow mouse movement
- **Annoying Draggable**: Modal that returns when dismissed
- **Corruption Level HUD**: Display showing system corruption
- **Central Stats Display**: Shows user's badges, corruption metrics

## Technical Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Context API for state management

## Educational Purpose

This project is meant to be educational and satirical - showcasing dark patterns so designers and users can recognize and avoid them. The patterns demonstrated here should never be used in real products. All real UI should be accessible, intuitive, and respectful of user agency.

## Running the Project

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Try to escape the nightmare ðŸ˜ˆ

## WARNING

This project is designed to be frustrating and manipulative. It's a satire and design experiment, not meant for actual production use. Using these patterns in real applications would be considered unethical and harmful to users.
